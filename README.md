# Secure Programmable SMS Integration (Python)

This project demonstrates a production-ready integration with the Infobip SMS API. It focuses on secure credential management and RESTful API communication, transitioning traditional telecom expertise into a modern "Communications as Code" workflow.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Security-First Architecture:** Utilizes environment variables (`.env`) to abstract sensitive API credentials.
* **REST API Integration:** Implements a robust POST request to the Infobip v3 messaging endpoint.
* **Scalable Data Structure:** Uses JSON payloads designed for multi-destination messaging.
* **Environment Isolation:** Managed via Python Virtual Environments (venv) for clean dependency tracking.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.14
* **Libraries:** `requests`, `python-dotenv`
* **API:** Infobip CPaaS (SMS Service)
* **Version Control:** Git/GitHub

## 🔐 Security Note
This repository includes a `.gitignore` file to ensure that local `.env` files and virtual environments are never exposed publicly, following industry best practices for API security.

## 📈 Sales Engineer Perspective
As a Sales Engineer, I built this to showcase the ability to bridge the gap between core telecom services and programmable software. This project highlights the importance of **security, documentation, and technical troubleshooting** when presenting solutions to clients.
